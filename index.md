<h2 id=about>About Me</h2>

<p>Hello! I'm an AI Ph.D. Researcher with a passion for Deep Learning and Neuro-Symbolic AI. My work focuses on constraint learning, interpretability, and causality, but I also believe in making AI accessible and beneficial for everyone.
I strongly advocate for true [OpenSourceAI](https://opensource.org/ai/open-source-ai-definition) and education being a right, not a privilege, as I believe collaboration and accessibility drive meaningful innovation.
When I'm not immersed in research, you can find me enjoying swimming, karate, playing Dungeons & Dragons,hiking and Latin dances. I also love creating multimedia content using AI generation models, blending technology with creativity.
I'm excited to connect with others who share a passion for AI and its potential to positively impact the world.</p>
