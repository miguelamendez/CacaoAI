<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>AI Ph.D. Researcher (6+ years of research experience) with expertise in Deep Learning and Neuro-Symbolic AI. My main research interests are in constraint learning, interpretability, and causality. I have a strong background in deep learning architectures: design, training and optimization. My current work has been in developing and implementing multi-agentic systems that use multi-modal large language models.</p>
